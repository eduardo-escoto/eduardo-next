I finally got around to finishing my website/portfolio. This was built from scratch using Gatsby as a static site generator and Bootstrap for the styling. 

I picked Gatsby so I could add my projects (and future blog posts) as markdown files for easy content creation. Another reason I picked Gatsby is because I love React, and while I'm not a web developer, writing React code is always a ton of fun, so its nice to use it in a personal project.

Took me long enough, but I'm happy I got it done!
